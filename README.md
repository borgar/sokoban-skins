# Sokoban skins

This is a collection of a few free [Sokoban][sk] skins by [Borgar Ãžorsteinsson][bt]. They were originally drawn for a desktop, and later a [JavaScript, implementation][js] of the game. 

The skins are provided with a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0][cc] license.

The skins exist in several sizes and flavours. Use them in your Sokoban programs. Credit me. Have fun!
